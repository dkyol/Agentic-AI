In unity, our spirits soar,
A crew united, wanting more.
Through stormy seas or skies so bright,
We stand together, day and night.

With shared dreams as our guiding star,
We navigate, near and far.
Each member's strength, a vital part,
Of this grand adventure, close to heart.

So let us raise our voices high,
A crew forever, reaching for the sky.
