Logline: A Kenyan woman defies political oppression and environmental destruction to create a grassroots movement that empowers women and reforests her nation, becoming the first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize.

Act I:
*   Opening scene: Wangari returns to her rural village to find it ravaged by deforestation for tea and coffee plantations, witnessing the displacement of families and the destruction of a sacred Mugumo tree. 
*   Wangari, inspired, starts the Green Belt Movement, facing skepticism from male village elders and resistance from government officials who see her as a threat to their land development plans.
*   Early successes: Women gain economic independence through tree planting, and the movement begins to restore degraded lands, providing firewood and preventing soil erosion.

Act II:
