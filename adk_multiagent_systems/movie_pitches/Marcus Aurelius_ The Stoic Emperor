Logline: A Roman Emperor, guided by Stoic philosophy, must confront war, plague, and the burden of leadership while striving to maintain his principles and protect his empire.

Synopsis: Introduction to Marcus Aurelius, his philosophical leanings (Stoicism - virtue, reason, living in accordance with nature), and his ascension to Emperor. Inciting incident: News arrives of a Parthian invasion in Armenia, challenging Roman authority and forcing Marcus to confront his pacifist ideals with the need to defend the empire. Setup of the political landscape, the looming threats of the Parthian War and the Marcomannic Wars, and the initial signs of the Antonine Plague.

Marcus Aurelius grapples with the responsibilities of leadership during wartime, specifically the Parthian War and the beginnings of the Marcomannic Wars. He faces difficult decisions, such as whether to prioritize military strength or uphold Stoic values of justice and compassion. The Antonine Plague intensifies, causing widespread death and social unrest. Marcus struggles to maintain order and provide guidance to his people, questioning whether his Stoic philosophy is sufficient to address the crisis. A specific philosophical conflict: Marcus must decide whether to impose harsh measures to control the plague, potentially violating individual liberties, or to allow the plague to run its course, risking greater loss of life.

Marcus Aurelius leads his troops in the Marcomannic Wars, facing both external enemies and internal challenges to his rule. He confronts the limitations of his power and the inevitability of death, especially as the plague continues to ravage the empire. He reflects on his life and legacy, solidifying his philosophical teachings in Meditations. The film concludes with his death and a brief glimpse of Commodus' reign, highlighting his descent into tyranny and self-deification through gladiatorial combat, contrasting sharply with Marcus Aurelius' commitment to virtue and reason, hinting at the end of the Pax Romana.
