Logline: A Roman Emperor, guided by Stoic philosophy, must confront war, plague, and the failings of his own son to preserve the Pax Romana and his own sanity.

Synopsis:
Act I: Introduction to Marcus Aurelius, his philosophical leanings, and the beginning of his reign. He inherits the throne and the responsibilities of emperor, including co-ruling with Lucius Verus. Early challenges include managing the vast empire and dealing with the initial rumblings of war on the borders. We see the development of his philosophical principles and his attempts to apply them to governance.

Act II: The Empire is beset by crises. The Parthian War and the Marcomannic Wars escalate, demanding Marcus's attention and military leadership. The Antonine Plague sweeps through the empire, causing widespread death and social disruption. Marcus struggles to balance his philosophical ideals with the harsh realities of war and disease. His relationship with his son, Commodus, begins to strain as Commodus shows little interest in philosophy or responsible leadership.

Act III: Marcus faces his mortality and the legacy he will leave behind. He successfully concludes the Marcomannic Wars but is weakened by the experience. He grapples with the knowledge that Commodus will succeed him, jeopardizing the stability of the empire and the principles he holds dear. Marcus dies, leaving behind his philosophical writings as a guide for future generations, but with a sense of foreboding about the future of Rome under Commodus' rule.
